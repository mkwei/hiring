# Requirement
You will have 25 minutes to work on the following 8 questions:
If you donâ€™t have time to write down the complete query, try to write down the steps of your thought process. If you feel the time is tight, focus more on questions 1~6. We put the needed data table(s) before each question and removed certain variables for simplicity. The data in the table are not limited to the rows demonstrated as examples. Please feel free to use MySQL, Oracle SQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL, Bigquery or any other SQL syntax you feel comfortable with.
